### This directory contains all the illumination correction pipelines used in the project.
- This pipeline is used to compensate for the non-uniformities in illumination present in microscopic images.
- Some of them were used on version 3.1.9 and others were used on v3.1.9 and others on v4.0.6 just to compare the results (note that jobs on v3.1.9 ran much faster).

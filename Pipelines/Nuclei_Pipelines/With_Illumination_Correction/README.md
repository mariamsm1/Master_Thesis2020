### The directory contains Nuclei segmentation pipelines used in Results-table-Cellprofiler-Evaluation and whose illumination was corrected.
- Numbers at the end of each project file correspond to the average F1 score obtained for each pipeline.
- **Cp_prediction_06269_40Images.cpproj** is tested on 40 nuclei images.
- Note on the best pipeline: 
1. Same result would be obtained if the theshold correction factor = 0.0 and the threshold smoothing scale = 0.0 and otsu = two classes.

### This directory contains images that were annotated by a master student at Aits Lab 
- Raw_annotations_nuclei contains the nuclei ground truth images that were used for evaluating nuclei images (CP input images were the same except that they end with .C01).

- More_raw_annotations_nuclei contains the 40 nuclei images that were used for extra evaluatipn of nuclei images to compare "with illumination correction" and "without illumination correction"(CP input images were the same except that they end with .C01).

- The number of spots and area in CP-segmented images were calculated based on best pipeline's segmentation (F1=0.3770).
- These were plotted against the number of spots and area of the raw annotations.
- The average number of lysosomes/cell was calculated for the best pipeline (F1=0.3770) and plotted (it's the same as average number of lysosomes/nucleus because CP segments cells based on nuclei). The nuclei were segmented from the best nuclei pipeline we obtained and those below 100 pixels were filtered out.
